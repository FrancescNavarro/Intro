# Intro
hey there, I'm Francesc, pleasure to meet you!

I'm currently leading M&A @factorial, a bcn based unicorn, and serving as investment manager @itnig. The coolest start-up ecosystem in bcn!

Also, I'm learning how to code. And I'm actually loving it, which kind of scares me. I'm currently pursuing a full-stack roadmap so atm i'm focused on learning fundamentals of html css and js. 

In this account you can find from financial models of public stocks, to essays on philosophy, to a couple indie-hacking projects that I plan to launch this year. 

Feel free to reach out for a coffee chat!
